# NimWinstaEveryoneAccess

This is my tryings in porting [Roguepotato's](https://github.com/antonioCoco/RoguePotato/) WinSta permission setting to allow everyone access to Nim.

Unfortunately it doesn't work for some `ADDACE` functions. I already spend hours on this and could't find the issue. If someone wants to help / take a look - or just wants to use parts of the code its published.
